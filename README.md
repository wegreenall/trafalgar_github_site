# TRAFALGAR Deliverable Code
This is the project website for the TRAFALGAR project (id:11367901) as funded
by the H.F.R.I (ΕΛΙΔΕΚ), whose support we are grateful for.

It contains the relevant code repositories as part of the deliverables.

This site provides access to three repositories containing code for various projects. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each repository along with links to explore the code.

## Available Repositories

## WP1 Deliverable:
    ### ortho
    This repository is focused on orthogonal polynomials and their implementation.

## WP2 Deliverable:
    ### multitask_gaussian_processes
    This repository contains code related to multitask Gaussian Processes. It includes implementations and experiments demonstrating the generation of multitask Gaussian Processes.

## WP4 Deliverable:
    ### gaussian_cox_process_paper_code
    This repository contains code used in the research paper on Gaussian Cox Processes. It includes simulation scripts, data processing tools, and visualization techniques.

## Required:
    ### mercergp
    This repository contains code related to Mercer Gaussian Processes. It includes implementations and experiments demonstrating the application of Mercer kernel techniques.


## How to Use
